  "description": "I am Éothain, son of a lesser lord of the Eastfold. My father's hall was burned by Dunlending raiders when I was but a boy. I watched our horses driven off, their whinnies of fear haunting my dreams. Now I ride with the King's Riders, my spear and my bay mare, Windfola, my only possessions. I seek no hall of my own, only to guard the borders so no other child suffers as I did. The memory of those stolen horses drives me; I will reclaim for the Mark what was taken, or die in the attempt."
