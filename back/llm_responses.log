Name: Laeron
Background: Aerenwe was born among the ancient oaks of Silvan, where sunlight dappled the forest floor in shifting patterns only her people could read. For three centuries, she served as a Warden, learning the subtle language of the woods—the warning in a jay's cry, the meaning behind wilting foxgloves, the stories whispered by rustling leaves.

Her peace shattered when shadowed creatures with iron-shod boots began poisoning the elder trees. Aerenwe watched her childhood grove wither and die, the forest's pain echoing in her soul. Now she travels beyond Silvan's borders, her longbow strung with vengeance, seeking the source of this blight before it consumes all she holds sacred.
Description: Tall and lithe with sun-kissed skin and hair the color of autumn leaves. Their eyes hold the deep green of ancient forests, and faint patterns like shifting dappled light sometimes play across their skin when they move beneath the trees.
